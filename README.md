This is a website that offers travel services to clients. On this site, I gained my first experience as a Team Lead. I collaborated with my groupmates, and we always supported each other, ensuring smooth operation.

My contributions to this site include:

   * Structuring the site: creating a comprehensive tree structure for all files and folders, downloading fonts, and connecting them. Prepared a template of all buttons and frames on the page for ease of use. I worked on IcoMoon for creating icon fonts.
   * "Popular Destinations" Block: This block is made with "Swiper in Swiper", where one shows a set of text while another displays images. They automatically change information together.
   * "Reviews" Block: This block is created using an auto-Swiper.
   * "Sharing" Block: Includes social network buttons. When users hover over the button, they can see a tooltip with the inscription "share."
   * English version of the site.

Ensured all my sections adhered to Perfect Pixel standards. During my work on this project, I used HTML, CSS for typesetting (extensively employing Flexbox), JavaScript (for working with Swipers), Git repository, and PerfectPixel. I also utilized Figma for the layout and Trello as a task board. I implemented Bootstrap and Swiper@11 libraries, converted, and compressed all images for optimal website performance.

The layout of the blocks is adaptive, ranging from the mobile version to the desktop version, ensuring correct display on tablets and other devices with adaptive adjustments for images, buttons, and text.

Additionally, I assisted throughout all stages for my team of site development.
